# MECH INTERP EXPLORE

The fundamental goal of this repo is to do mini-project exploration/reproduction on some of the papers I find interesting the MOR GEVA course. At the start stage, I will be prioritizing reproduction on some essential bits of the papers to get the lay of the land. Subsequently, I will be addressing some gaps I find worthy of pursuing. This is essentially a curiosity-driven adventure!
